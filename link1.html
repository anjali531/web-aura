   <h1>Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System</h1>
   <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2>
   <p>As part of the project, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) opened a new satellite navigation centre within the campus of ISRO Deep Space Network (DSN) at Byalalu, in Karnataka on 28 May 2013. A network of 21 ranging stations located across the country will provide data for the orbital determination of the satellites and monitoring of the navigation signal.A goal of complete Indian control has been stated, with the space segment, ground segment and user receivers all being built in India. Its location in low latitudes facilitates a coverage with low-inclination satellites. Three satellites will be in geostationary orbit over the Indian Ocean. Missile targeting could be an important military application for the constellation.</p>

   <p><right>The total cost of the project was expected to be ₹14.2 billion (US$205 million), with the cost of the ground segment being ₹3 billion (US$43 million), each satellite costing ₹1.5 billion (US$22 million) and the PSLV-XL version rocket costing around ₹1.3 billion (US$19 million). The planned seven rockets would have involved an outlay of around ₹9.1 billion (US$132 million).The necessity for two replacement satellites, and PSLV-XL launches, has altered the original budget, with the Comptroller and Auditor General of India reporting costs, to March 2017, at ₹22.46 billion (US$325 million). The NAVIC signal was released for evaluation in September 2014.</p>

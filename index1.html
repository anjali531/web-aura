  <h2>INTODUCTION</h2>
  <p>The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS) with an operational name of NAVIC ( NAVigation with Indian Constellation) is an autonomous regional satellite navigation system that provides accurate real-time positioning and timing services. The constellation is in orbit as of 2018, and the system was expected to be operational from early 2018 after a system check. NAVIC will provide two levels of service, the "standard positioning service", which will be open for civilian use, and a "restricted service" (an encrypted one) for authorised users (including the military). There are plans to expand the NAVIC system by increasing its constellation size from 7 to 11.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p>The system was developed partly because access to foreign government-controlled global navigation satellite systems is not guaranteed in hostile situations, as happened to the Indian military in 1999 when it was dependent on the American Global Positioning System (GPS) during the Kargil War. The Indian government approved the project in May 2013.</p>
